# Editorial board

The editorial board is made of people who are committed to the open source
community and are both experienced developper and strongly familiar with the
GitHub ecosystem. Each editorial board member is specialised in a specific
domain of Science and is proficient in several programming languages and/or
environments. While many of us work primarily in Python, ReScience also
accepts submissions in other open source languages.
