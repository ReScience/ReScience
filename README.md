[Re**Science**](https://rescience.github.io) is a peer-reviewed journal that
targets computational research and encourages the explicit reproduction of
already published research promoting new and open-source implementations in
order to ensure the original research is reproducible. To achieve such a goal,
the whole editing chain is radically different from any other traditional
scientific journal. Re**Science** lives on
[github](https://github.com/ReScience/) where each new implementation is made
available together with the comments, explanations and tests. Each submission
takes the form of a pull request that is publicly reviewed and tested in order
to guarantee any researcher can re-use it. If you ever reproduced computational
result from the literature, Re**Science** is the perfect place to publish this
new implementation.
