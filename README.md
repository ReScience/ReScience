## The ReScience Journal

**Note:** This repository contains the first volumes of ReScience. Articles were
submitted as pull requests and merged upon acceptance. This workflow turned out
to be a bit cumbersome and restrictive for authors, which is why we adopted
a new one based on two repositories: one for [submissions](https://github.com/ReScience/submissions)
and a different one containing the accepted [articles](https://github.com/ReScience/articles).
The entry point for ReScience remains its [Web site](https://rescience.github.io/).

[Re**Science**](https://rescience.github.io) is a peer-reviewed journal that
targets computational research and encourages the explicit replication of
already published research promoting new and open-source implementations in
order to ensure the original research is reproducible. To achieve such a goal,
the whole editing chain is radically different from any other traditional
scientific journal. Re**Science** lives on
[github](https://github.com/ReScience/) where each new implementation is made
available together with the comments, explanations and tests. Each submission
takes the form of a pull request that is publicly reviewed and tested in order
to guarantee any researcher can re-use it. If you ever replicated a computational
result from the literature, Re**Science** is the perfect place to publish this
new implementation. **Reproducible Science is Good. Replicated Science is better.**
